# City data model - Transport service

## Project Summary

This site defines an ontology for service-level concepts defined for the transport domain using terms specified in ISO/IEC 5087-1 and ISO/IEC-5087-2. The values for service-level concepts defined by this site are intended to be managed by the transport domain but accessible by multiple city services and stakeholders.
